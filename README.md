CSc110
======

Assignments and lab materials from Introduction to Computer Science (CSc110), Sep-Dec 2008, at the University of Victoria.  It's all really basic Java.  This is the start of my post-degree info dump.  :)

a01
Static methods, assignment statements, data flow, and documentation.
Part 1 calculates the first forty digits of pi, part two draws a totem pole.

a02
Scanner class, parametrized methods, int and double types, and writing clarity.
Calculates daily operational hours and costs for Vancouver Island Ferry System.  Not realistic!

a03
Reading text files, test strategies, conditional statements, if/else statements, program logic, arrays, parametrized loops, indefinite loops, invalid inputs, re-factoring, and modelling.
Part 1 calculates individual student grades, part 2 adds multiple students.  Uses Scanner class and a text file.

a04
Using arrays to locate table elements, reading arrays with explicit and computed indices.  Pair programming.
Part 1 uses sound editing and basic effects, part 2 adds a little creativity.

a05
Instance variables, instance methods, constructor methods, and two dimensional arrays.  Pair programming.
A Battleship knock-off!
