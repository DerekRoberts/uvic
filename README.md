CSc115 - Introduction to Java pt.2
========

Assignments and lab materials from Introduction to Computer Science (CSc115), Jan-Apr 2009, at the University of Victoria. It's all really basic Java. This is the part of my post-degree info dump and follows the Java-pt1 repository. :)

a01 - Reading from files, writing to files, string basics and command line parameters (cmd.exe).  It's a basic contact manager.

a02 - Linked lists, following specifications, limitations of doubles, javadoc commenting and testing.  This adds to the beginning and end of linked lists.

a03 - Linear search, binary search and recursive solutions.  Parts 1 and 2 change the linear and binary searches to use recursion.

a04 - Exceptions, postfix expressions and stacks.  Part 1 is a stack and part 2 is a basic calculator with exception handling.

a05 - Binary trees, groups of projects, GUIs, more exception handling and algorithm basics.  All four parts are for a calculator built using a binary tree.  This assignment was shortened due to class time constraints and some odd scheduling.

Examples - Pre-supplied files, including iterators and linked lists.
