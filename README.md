SEng265 - Software Development Methods
========

Assignments from Software Development Methods (SEng265), May-Aug 2011, at the University of Victoria.  We learned a bit about C and to build a simple GUI in Python using TkInter.  Also, software development methods.

a01 - Team programming.  Hashing, binary search, excution time comparisons (binary search wins, by with increasing n) and makefiles.  Building a word storage module felt almost useful, so I could get used to this!  :D

a02 - Team programming.  Simplicity, bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, code testing and quiz writing with a pre-existing code library.

a03 - Team programming.  Python basics and TkInter GUI with options to add, remove and delete question groups, add and remove directories, drop-down menus and other basic GUI functions.  It's a front end for the professor's code, which I believe will be used to test neighbourhood high school students.
