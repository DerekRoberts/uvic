SEng310 - Human Computer Interaction
========

Group project, a prototype Proctoring environment, broken down into assignment deliverables.  From SEng310, May-Aug 2012, at the University of Victoria.

a01 - fork(), execvp(), getcwd(), chdir(), nohup, kill(), lots of other commands, background execution and process management.  It's a Realistic Shell Interpreter (RSI).

a02 - Threads, race conditions, mutexes, condition variables (convars), pthread library, flows and reading input files.  It's a router simulator that handles "traffic" from an input file.

a03 - A utility for reading and writing FAT12.  It can create, read, list, get and put (write) contents into a disk image (IMG file).  Rather than using tons of new commands and concepts it's pretty heavy on understanding FAT12.

a04 - Pre-exam Q&A.  Nothing to write home about, especially compared to the programming assignments!
