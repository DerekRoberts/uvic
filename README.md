CSc360 - Operating Systems
========

Assignments from Operating Systems (CSc360) at the University of Victoria.  We learned about operating systems by building parts of them using C.  This was one of my favourite classes, because it finally felt like I had created something.  Not that the world needs another command line interpreter for Linux or my personal mangling of file allocations tables.  ;)

a01 - Reading from files, writing to files, string basics and command line parameters (cmd.exe).  It's a basic contact manager.

a02 - Linked lists, following specifications, limitations of doubles, javadoc commenting and testing.  This adds to the beginning and end of linked lists.

a03 - Linear search, binary search and recursive solutions.  Parts 1 and 2 change the linear and binary searches to use recursion.
