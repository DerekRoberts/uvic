CSc360 - Operating Systems
========

Assignments from Operating Systems (CSc360) at the University of Victoria.  We learned about operating systems by building parts of them using C.  This was one of my favourite classes, because it finally felt like I had created something.  Not that the world needs another shell interpreter for Linux or my personal mangling of file allocations tables.  ;)

a01 - fork(), execvp(), getcwd(), chdir(), nohup, kill(), lots of other commands, background execution and process management.  It's a Realistic Shell Interpreter (RSI).

a02 - Threads, race conditions, mutexes, condition variables (convars), pthread library, flows and reading input files.  It's a router simulator that handles "traffic" from an input file.

a03 - A utility for reading and writing FAT12.  It can create, read, list, get and put (write) contents into a disk image (IMG file).  Rather than using tons of new commands and concepts it's pretty heavy on understanding FAT12.

a04 - Pre-exam Q&A.  Nothing to write home about, especially compared to the programming assignments!
