SEng310 - Human Computer Interaction
========

Group project, a prototype Proctoring environment, broken down into assignment deliverables.  From SEng310, May-Aug 2012, at the University of Victoria.

a01 - User and task analysis.  + Personas, scenarios, sample questions and interviewing students and professotrs/testers for opinions.

a02 - Paper (okay, PDF) prototype.  + Proposals, further interviewing, consent forms, project forms, report writing, more personas and more user and task analysis.  We were encouraged to be creative, which is a welcome change!  :D

a03 - Software prototype.  Written in java.  Run with "java -jar ProctoLearningSystem.jar".

a04 - Usability evaluation.  + Inspection and heuristic evaluation of another group's project.

a05 - User Evaluation.  This was far more interesting than it was humiliating!

a06 - Final Project Report.  Presentation not included, but I assure you it was glorious.  ;)

Misc - Consent forms, project forms, testing plans and mock project management.
