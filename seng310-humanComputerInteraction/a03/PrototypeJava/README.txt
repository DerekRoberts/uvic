Here you will find the first high fidelity prototype of our groups learning management system, Procto Learning System.

Required software:

Instructions for running:

	In a command prompt, navigate to the directory containing this README and the ProctoLearningSystem.jar and type:
		java -jar ProctoLearningSystem.jar

	You could also try just double-clicking on ProctoLearningSystem.jar in your file browser.
