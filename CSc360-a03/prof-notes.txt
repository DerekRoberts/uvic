Hi:

The disk image file was created with a disk burner software. You probably have noticed that there might be an inconsistency between the "Volume label" field in the Boot sector and the volume label file in the root directory (They must match, i.e., whenever one is changed, the other must be changed accordingly). This inconsistency may be caused by a bug in the burner software.

 

In Assignment 3, you should check both: the Volume label field in the Boot Sector and the volume label file in the root directory. If they are not the same, output the one recored in the volume lable file in the root directory.
