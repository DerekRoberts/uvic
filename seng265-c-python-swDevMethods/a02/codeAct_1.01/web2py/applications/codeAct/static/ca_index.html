codeAct is a fill-in-the-blanks game which tests your knowledge
of programming.
<p>
In the game, you are given a sequence of tasks.
Each task displays a game board with three rectangular cells:
<ol>
<li>
<i>code cell</i>: a program in a programming language,
<li>
<i>argv cell</i>: text available as command line arguments,
<li>
<i>stdin cell</i>: text available as standard input, and
<li>
<i>stdout cell</i>: text written as standard input.
</ol>
Each cell contains some fixed text and some text fields.
Your job is to fill in the text fields.
<p>
There are four task types, each with slightly different game rules:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="../ca_controller/quiz.html?quiz_spec=../quiz_specs/min_io_alone">Input-output</a>:
When you press the <i>check answer</i> button, the code is executed.
The actual output of the execution is saved.
Your answer is correct if the actual output is the same as
the contents of the stdout cell.
<li>
<a href="../ca_controller/quiz.html?quiz_spec=../quiz_specs/min_be_alone">Bullseye</a>:
In this task, the code cell contains one or more
<font color="blue"><b>highlighted</b></font> lines.
When you press the <i>check answer</i> button, the code is executed.
Your answer is correct if each of the highlighted lines
was executed at least once.
<li>
<a href="../ca_controller/quiz.html?quiz_spec=../quiz_specs/min_ll_alone">Liar-liar</a>:
In this task, the code cell contains one or more
<font color="blue"><b>assert</b></font> lines.
When you press the <i>check answer</i> button, the code is executed.
Your answer is correct if each of the assertions
was false during execution.
<li>
<a href="../ca_controller/quiz.html?quiz_spec=../quiz_specs/min_ff_alone">Find-the-failure</a>:
In this task, the code cell contains a specification and an implementation
of a function, and an invocation of that function.
When you press the <i>check answer</i> button, the code is executed.
Your answer is correct if the return value of the function
is incorrect, with respect to the specification
</ol>
